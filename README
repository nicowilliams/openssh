NOTE WELL:

    This is a *MIRROR* of the OpenSSH CVS repo at:
        anoncvs@anoncvs.mindrot.org:/cvs

NOTE WELL:

    As of 2013-07-19 this mirror is NOT being maintained up to date with
    its CVS upstream.

This mirror was created on 2013-07-19 using git cvsimport.  I'm not yet
sure how to gateway subsequent updates to the CVS repo into this git
repo, but I'd like to provide that service.  -Nico


The original OpenSSH README has been renamed to README.original.


I provide this mirror with no guarantees, no warrantees, no nothing.

My branches will be named nico-*.  Do not use them without reviewing
them, and in all case you should check that the based for any of my
patches matches the content found in the OpenSSH repo for that base.
